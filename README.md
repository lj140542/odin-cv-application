# Odin's CV Application

## 🔍 Description
This project is part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum. This project goal was to build an app to generate a CV using React. 

My objectives when building this project were : 
- use React State to ensure real-time updating of elements on the displayed CV 
- use React Components to factorize as much code as possible (while maintaining an understandable code base)
- keep accessibility principles in mind (mainly "keyboard only" use and color contrasts in this case)
- produce a responsive design
